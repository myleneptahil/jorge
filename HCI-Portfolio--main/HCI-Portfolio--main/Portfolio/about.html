    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I was a student at Sacred Heart School-Hijas de Jesus during elementary and PAREF Springdale during Highschool recieving a good level of education. While at these schools, I was playing and competing in football competitions where I was mostly a utility player. Currently, I am a student of BSIT at CIE where I am hoping to build for the future.</p>

    <p>Outside of school my hobbies are playing video games and watching anime along with other forms of media related to it. I quite enjoy the presentation of characters and the stories that these forms of media have to share. Overall, they are a lot of fun.</p>
    <h3>Some of my favorite series:</h3>
